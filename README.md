All notes and code which helped me to understand better whant is Docker is collected here. Hope that can be useful also for you :) 

First of all, the following files were included:
<ol>
    <li> docker-demo is a first trial of docker container. Especially, only a simple python script was included into the docker image. </li>
    <li> IntroDocker.svg collects some notes about docker's functionalities.  </li>
</ol>
